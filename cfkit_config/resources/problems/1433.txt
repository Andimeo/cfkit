standard output
There is a building consisting of $$$10~000$$$ apartments numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$10~000$$$, inclusive.
Call an apartment
boring
, if its number consists of
the same digit
. Examples of boring apartments are $$$11, 2, 777, 9999$$$ and so on.
Our character is a troublemaker, and he calls the intercoms of all
boring
apartments, till someone answers the call, in the following order:
First he calls all apartments consisting of digit $$$1$$$, in increasing order ($$$1, 11, 111, 1111$$$).
Next he calls all apartments consisting of digit $$$2$$$, in increasing order ($$$2, 22, 222, 2222$$$)
And so on.
The resident of the boring apartment $$$x$$$ answers the call, and our character
stops
calling anyone further.
Our character wants to know how many digits he pressed in total and your task is to help him to count the total number of keypresses.
For example, if the resident of boring apartment $$$22$$$ answered, then our character called apartments with numbers $$$1, 11, 111, 1111, 2, 22$$$ and the total number of digits he pressed is $$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 13$$$.
You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 36$$$) — the number of test cases.
The only line of the test case contains one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le 9999$$$) — the apartment number of the resident who answered the call. It is guaranteed that $$$x$$$ consists of the same digit.
Output
For each test case, print the answer: how many digits our character pressed in total.

standard output
There is a bookshelf which can fit $$$n$$$ books. The $$$i$$$-th position of bookshelf is $$$a_i = 1$$$ if there is a book on this position and $$$a_i = 0$$$ otherwise. It is guaranteed that there is
at least one book
on the bookshelf.
In one move, you can choose some contiguous segment $$$[l; r]$$$ consisting of books (i.e. for each $$$i$$$ from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ the condition $$$a_i = 1$$$ holds) and:
Shift it to the right by $$$1$$$: move the book at index $$$i$$$ to $$$i + 1$$$ for all $$$l \le i \le r$$$. This move can be done only if $$$r+1 \le n$$$ and there is no book at the position $$$r+1$$$.
Shift it to the left by $$$1$$$: move the book at index $$$i$$$ to $$$i-1$$$ for all $$$l \le i \le r$$$. This move can be done only if $$$l-1 \ge 1$$$ and there is no book at the position $$$l-1$$$.
Your task is to find the
minimum
number of moves required to collect all the books on the shelf as a
contiguous
(consecutive) segment (i.e. the segment without any gaps).
For example, for $$$a = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]$$$ there is a gap between books ($$$a_4 = 0$$$ when $$$a_3 = 1$$$ and $$$a_5 = 1$$$), for $$$a = [1, 1, 0]$$$ there are no gaps between books and for $$$a = [0, 0,0]$$$ there are also no gaps between books.
You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 200$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.
The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 50$$$) — the number of places on a bookshelf. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 1$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is $$$1$$$ if there is a book at this position and $$$0$$$ otherwise. It is guaranteed that there is
at least one book
on the bookshelf.
Output
For each test case, print one integer: the
minimum
number of moves required to collect all the books on the shelf as a contiguous (consecutive) segment (i.e. the segment without gaps).

C. Dominant Piranha

input
standard input
output
standard output
There are $$$n$$$ piranhas with sizes $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ in the aquarium. Piranhas are numbered from left to right in order they live in the aquarium.
Scientists of the Berland State University want to find if there is
dominant
piranha in the aquarium. The piranha is called
dominant
if it can eat all the other piranhas in the aquarium (except itself, of course). Other piranhas will do nothing while the
dominant
piranha will eat them.
Because the aquarium is pretty narrow and long, the piranha can eat only one of the adjacent piranhas during one move. Piranha can do as many moves as it needs (or as it can). More precisely:
The piranha $$$i$$$ can eat the piranha $$$i-1$$$ if the piranha $$$i-1$$$ exists and $$$a_{i - 1} < a_i$$$.
The piranha $$$i$$$ can eat the piranha $$$i+1$$$ if the piranha $$$i+1$$$ exists and $$$a_{i + 1} < a_i$$$.
When the piranha $$$i$$$ eats some piranha, its
size increases by one
($$$a_i$$$ becomes $$$a_i + 1$$$).
Your task is to find
any dominant
piranha in the aquarium or determine if there are no such piranhas.
Note that you have to find
any
(exactly one) dominant piranha, you don't have to find all of them.
For example, if $$$a = [5, 3, 4, 4, 5]$$$, then the third piranha can be
dominant
. Consider the sequence of its moves:
The piranha eats the second piranha and $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[5, \underline{5}, 4, 5]$$$ (the underlined piranha is our candidate).
The piranha eats the third piranha and $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[5, \underline{6}, 5]$$$.
The piranha eats the first piranha and $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[\underline{7}, 5]$$$.
The piranha eats the second piranha and $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[\underline{8}]$$$.
You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.
The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of piranhas in the aquarium. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the size of the $$$i$$$-th piranha.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\sum n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$).
Output
For each test case, print the answer:
-1
if there are no dominant piranhas in the aquarium or
index
of
any
dominant piranha otherwise. If there are several answers, you can print any.

standard output
There are $$$n$$$ districts in the town, the $$$i$$$-th district belongs to the $$$a_i$$$-th bandit gang. Initially, no districts are connected to each other.
You are the mayor of the city and want to build $$$n-1$$$ two-way roads to connect all districts (two districts can be connected directly or through other connected districts).
If two districts belonging to the same gang are connected
directly
with a road, this gang will revolt.
You don't want this so your task is to build $$$n-1$$$ two-way roads in such a way that all districts are reachable from each other (possibly, using intermediate districts) and
each pair
of directly connected districts belong to
different gangs
, or determine that it is impossible to build $$$n-1$$$ roads to satisfy all the conditions.
You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.
The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 5000$$$) — the number of districts. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the gang the $$$i$$$-th district belongs to.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$5000$$$ ($$$\sum n \le 5000$$$).
Output
For each test case, print:
NO
on the only line if it is impossible to connect all districts satisfying the conditions from the problem statement.
YES
on the first line and $$$n-1$$$ roads on the next $$$n-1$$$ lines. Each road should be presented as a pair of integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i, y_i \le n; x_i \ne y_i$$$), where $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ are two districts the $$$i$$$-th road connects.
For each road $$$i$$$, the condition $$$a[x_i] \ne a[y_i]$$$ should be satisfied. Also, all districts should be reachable from each other (possibly, using intermediate districts).

standard output
One day, $$$n$$$ people ($$$n$$$ is an even number) met on a plaza and made two round dances, each round dance consists of exactly $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ people. Your task is to find the number of ways $$$n$$$ people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ people. Each person should belong to exactly one of these two round dances.
Round dance is a dance circle consisting of $$$1$$$ or more people. Two round dances are indistinguishable (equal) if one can be transformed to another by choosing the first participant. For example, round dances $$$[1, 3, 4, 2]$$$, $$$[4, 2, 1, 3]$$$ and $$$[2, 1, 3, 4]$$$ are indistinguishable.
For example, if $$$n=2$$$ then the number of ways is $$$1$$$: one round dance consists of the first person and the second one of the second person.
For example, if $$$n=4$$$ then the number of ways is $$$3$$$. Possible options:
one round dance — $$$[1,2]$$$, another — $$$[3,4]$$$;
one round dance — $$$[2,4]$$$, another — $$$[3,1]$$$;
one round dance — $$$[4,1]$$$, another — $$$[3,2]$$$.
Your task is to find the number of ways $$$n$$$ people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ people.
Input
The input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 20$$$), $$$n$$$ is an even number.
Output
Print one integer — the number of ways to make two round dances. It is guaranteed that the answer fits in the $$$64$$$-bit integer data type.

standard output
You are given a matrix $$$a$$$ of size $$$n \times m$$$ consisting of integers.
You can choose
no more than
$$$\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor$$$ elements in
each row
. Your task is to choose these elements in such a way that their sum is
divisible by
$$$k$$$ and this sum is the
maximum
.
In other words, you can choose no more than a half (rounded down) of elements in each row, you have to find the maximum sum of these elements divisible by $$$k$$$.
Note that you can choose zero elements (and the sum of such set is $$$0$$$).
Input
The first line of the input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m, k \le 70$$$) — the number of rows in the matrix, the number of columns in the matrix and the value of $$$k$$$. The next $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ elements each, where the $$$j$$$-th element of the $$$i$$$-th row is $$$a_{i, j}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_{i, j} \le 70$$$).
Output
Print one integer — the maximum sum divisible by $$$k$$$ you can obtain.

standard output
You are a mayor of Berlyatov. There are $$$n$$$ districts and $$$m$$$ two-way roads between them. The $$$i$$$-th road connects districts $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$. The cost of travelling along this road is $$$w_i$$$. There is some path between each pair of districts, so the city is connected.
There are $$$k$$$ delivery routes in Berlyatov. The $$$i$$$-th route is going from the district $$$a_i$$$ to the district $$$b_i$$$. There is one courier on each route and the courier will always choose the
cheapest
(minimum by total cost) path from the district $$$a_i$$$ to the district $$$b_i$$$ to deliver products.
The route can go from the district to itself, some couriers routes can coincide (
and you have to count them independently
).
You can make at most one road to have cost zero (i.e. you choose at most one road and change its cost with $$$0$$$).
Let $$$d(x, y)$$$ be the cheapest cost of travel between districts $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.
Your task is to find the minimum total courier routes cost you can achieve, if you optimally select the some road and change its cost with $$$0$$$. In other words, you have to find the minimum possible value of $$$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{k} d(a_i, b_i)$$$ after applying the operation described above optimally.
Input
The first line of the input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 1000$$$; $$$n - 1 \le m \le min(1000, \frac{n(n-1)}{2})$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 1000$$$) — the number of districts, the number of roads and the number of courier routes.
The next $$$m$$$ lines describe roads. The $$$i$$$-th road is given as three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ and $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i, y_i \le n$$$; $$$x_i \ne y_i$$$; $$$1 \le w_i \le 1000$$$), where $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ are districts the $$$i$$$-th road connects and $$$w_i$$$ is its cost. It is guaranteed that there is some path between each pair of districts, so the city is connected. It is also guaranteed that there is at most one road between each pair of districts.
The next $$$k$$$ lines describe courier routes. The $$$i$$$-th route is given as two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$$$) — the districts of the $$$i$$$-th route. The route can go from the district to itself, some couriers routes can coincide (
and you have to count them independently
).
Output
Print one integer — the
minimum
total courier routes cost you can achieve (i.e. the minimum value $$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k} d(a_i, b_i)$$$, where $$$d(x, y)$$$ is the cheapest cost of travel between districts $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$) if you can make some (
at most one
) road cost zero.
