Explanation
The reward for the job at location $$$2$$$ is $$$30 \cdot 2 \cdot (2 + 5) = 420$$$ credits.
The reward for the job at location $$$3$$$ is $$$29 \cdot 1 \cdot (1 + 5) = 174$$$ credits.
The job at location $$$4$$$ is not completed.
We have to pay $$$240 + 71 = 311$$$ credits to the first worker.
We also have to pay $$$240 + 40 = 280$$$ credits to the second worker.
Profit: $$$420 + 174 - 311 - 280 = 3$$$.
Note that this example is too short ($$$n < 500$$$) and so does not appear in the testing system. It is included for explanatory purposes only.
Scoring
Each test is scored independently. The score for a test is the profit divided by $$$1000$$$. It the profit is negative, the score is equal to zero. If a solution did not output a valid answer on a certain test, the result for this test is also zero.
Testing
Your solution will be checked on sets of tests generated in advance. A solution's score is the sum of its results on all the tests. If a solution did not output a valid answer on a certain test, the result for this test is zero.
During the main phase of the contest, there are two ways to submit a solution.
The first one, problem A1, is to check on examples. There are $$$10$$$ example tests which are also available for local testing. As soon as the solution is checked, you can see reports for all examples by clicking on the submission result. The tests for A1 are open, you can download them from the links

(for Linux) and
https://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/1160/codeforces-vrt-2019.zip
(for Windows). After testing, you can click the verdict of your submission to see the result for each test.
The second way, problem A2, is to check on preliminary tests. There are $$$100$$$ preliminary tests which are generated in advance but kept secret. The score for preliminary tests (but not for example tests) is used in the preliminary scoreboard. This score does not affect the final results, but nevertheless allows to roughly compare a solution with others.
After the main phase ends, for each participant, the system chooses the final solution:
consider all solutions sent for
preliminary testing
;
choose the ones which got a total score strictly greater than zero;
define the final solution as the one of chosen solutions which has
the latest
submission time.
Note that the solutions sent only to be checked on examples are not considered when choosing the final solution.
During final testing, all final solutions will be checked on the same set of a large number ($$$\approx 1000$$$) of final tests. The score for final tests determines the final scoreboard. The winner is the contestant whose solution gets the highest total score. In case two or more participants have equal total score, the contestants with such score tie for the same place.
