Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.
But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.
This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.
Input
The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters — the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.
Output
If it is a female by our hero's method, print "
CHAT WITH HER!
" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "
IGNORE HIM!
" (without the quotes).

Let's denote
d
(
n
)
as the number of divisors of a positive integer
n
. You are given three integers
a
,
b
and
c
. Your task is to calculate the following sum:
Find the sum modulo
1073741824
(2
30
)
.
Input
The first line contains three space-separated integers
a
,
b
and
c
(
1 ≤
a
,
b
,
c
≤ 100
).
Output
Print a single integer — the required sum modulo
1073741824

Some days ago, I learned the concept of LCM (least common multiple). I've played with it for several times and I want to make a big number with it.
But I also don't want to use many numbers, so I'll choose three positive integers (they don't have to be distinct) which are not greater than
n
. Can you help me to find the maximum possible least common multiple of these three integers?
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1 ≤
n
≤ 10
6
) — the
n
mentioned in the statement.
Output
Print a single integer — the maximum possible LCM of three not necessarily distinct positive integers that are not greater than
n
.

D. Let's Play Osu!

You're playing a game called Osu! Here's a simplified version of it. There are
n
clicks in a game. For each click there are two outcomes: correct or bad. Let us denote correct as "
O
", bad as "
X
", then the whole play can be encoded as a sequence of
n
characters "
O
" and "
X
".
Using the play sequence you can calculate the score for the play as follows: for every maximal consecutive "
O
"s block, add the square of its length (the number of characters "
O
") to the score. For example, if your play can be encoded as "
OOXOOOXXOO
", then there's three maximal consecutive "
O
"s block "
OO
", "
OOO
", "
OO
", so your score will be
2
2
+ 3
2
+ 2
2
= 17
. If there are no correct clicks in a play then the score for the play equals to
0
.
You know that the probability to click the
i
-th
(1 ≤
i
≤
n
)
click correctly is
p
i
. In other words, the
i
-th character in the play sequence has
p
i
probability to be "
O
",
1 -
p
i
to be "
X
". You task is to calculate the expected score for your play.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1 ≤
n
≤ 10
5
) — the number of clicks. The second line contains
n
space-separated real numbers
p
1
,
p
2
, ...,
p
n
(0 ≤
p
i
≤ 1)
.
There will be at most six digits after the decimal point in the given
p
i
.
Output
Print a single real number — the expected score for your play. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10
- 6
.

standard output
Some days ago, WJMZBMR learned how to answer the query "how many times does a string
x
occur in a string
s
" quickly by preprocessing the string
s
. But now he wants to make it harder.
So he wants to ask "how many consecutive substrings of
s
are cyclical isomorphic to a given string
x
". You are given string
s
and
n
strings
x
i
, for each string
x
i
find, how many consecutive substrings of
s
are cyclical isomorphic to
x
i
.
Two strings are called
cyclical isomorphic
if one can rotate one string to get the other one. 'Rotate' here means 'to take some consecutive chars (maybe none) from the beginning of a string and put them back at the end of the string in the same order'. For example, string "
abcde
" can be rotated to string "
deabc
". We can take characters "
abc
" from the beginning and put them at the end of "
de
".
Input
The first line contains a non-empty string
s
. The length of string
s
is not greater than
10
6
characters.
The second line contains an integer
n
(
1 ≤
n
≤ 10
5
) — the number of queries. Then
n
lines follow: the
i
-th line contains the string
x
i
— the string for the
i
-th query. The total length of
x
i
is less than or equal to
10
6
characters.
In this problem, strings only consist of lowercase English letters.
Output
For each query
x
i
print a single integer that shows how many consecutive substrings of
s
are cyclical isomorphic to
x
i
. Print the answers to the queries in the order they are given in the input.
