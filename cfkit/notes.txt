In gif:
- extension(s): py cpp

Need to fix test go program so that he write memory usage and time even if an error happen
Need to fix test go program so that he write error with c++ file (test your solution with c++ file and you will see)
change execute command in languages.json to compile command for compiled languages

remove the question that ask about removing tests folder when the folder is not empty at first

remove kotlin and c mono from one line compiled

delete compile code option in go program

ask the user even there is one option for executing command

add example 1 feature like in codeforces (n and arr is an example)

"Please add the appro" (search with ctrl + shift + f)

ADD TIME CONDITION WHEN PRINTING THE RESULT (TIME LIMIT EXCEED)

test this (
            accepeted = False
            checker_log_list[i] += err
            verdict[i] = colored_text("Formatting error", one_color="error_4",return_statement=True)
            save_first_error("Formatting error", i + 1)
            errors["Formatting error"] += 1
            CONTINUE)

custom input without output option (in1 without out1)

remove x from print results (not expected_output_bool condition)

add to the documentation that (core dump) in c++ while enabling memory and time trace not showing (1 / 0 in c++ while running ./a.out for example)

Idleness limit exceeded on test 1 when the time exceeded and there is no output

add line number in answer and output check log before |
example
1 |
2 |
3 |
4 |


remove rmtree from common (shutil)

change samples_dir, follow filename exists in utils.variables

remove checking path in fetch_samples function in common.py (if not necessary to check path)

default_submission language in languages.json should contain a list, the name and the value (see submit.py dict)

"""
Detect the implementation type (compiler or interpreter) from the provided file
and execute it with sample input and output while managing memory usage.
"""


fetch.py is okay

print error if exit code is not zero

add to the documentation that the program remove extra spaces on each line in the end, and remove extra new lines in the end of the output

add to the documentation php and maybe other languages will print errors to output file
