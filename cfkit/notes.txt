Need to fix test go program so that he write memory usage and time even if an error happen
Need to fix test go program so that he write error with c++ file (test your solution with c++ file and you will see)
change execute command in languages.json to compile command for compiled languages

remove the question that ask about removing tests folder when the folder is not empty at first

remove kotlin and c mono from one line compiled

ask the user even there is one option for executing command

add example 1 feature like in codeforces (n and arr is an example)

add to the documentation that (core dump) in c++ while enabling memory and time trace not showing (1 / 0 in c++ while running ./a.out for example)
