1. Introduction

Overview: 
cfkit is a handy command-line interface (CLI) tool designed mainly for Codeforces users to make competitive programming easier. It focuses primarily on comparing results, fetching problem samples, and automating various tasks related to coding contests. By streamlining these processes, cfkit helps programmers focus more on solving problems and less on managing competition details.

cfkit provides several useful features for competitive programming:

Efficient Result Comparison: floating-point numbers comparison, any order comparison, strict comparison
High Traffic Resilience: Can parse problem data effectively, even if the server is under heavy load.
Language Support: Supports all programming languages used on Codeforces.
Fetch Problem Samples: Retrieves sample inputs and outputs for problems.
Local Compilation and Testing: compile and test your code locally.
Template-Based Code Generation: Generates code from predefined templates, including details such as timestamp and author.
Contest Problem Stats: Lists statistics for problems in a specific contest.
Colorful CLI Output: Enhances the command-line interface with colored output to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers easily.

2. Installation
Ensure Python is installed on your system. Then, run these commands in your terminal:
pip install cfkit
cf config all
And your are ready to go!

3. Usage

cf run 2000a.cpp   Compiles and tests your solution locally.
                   It fetches and parses sample test cases if they are missing,
                   then compares your output with the expected results,
                   highlighting any differences.

Here are some cool options you can use with cf run:

-o: Accepts answers in any order
-c: Runs only custom samples (in{number}, out{number}) or runs with custom input (in{number}) without comparing results
-s: Does not ignore extra spaces during comparison
-n: Does not ignore extra new lines during comparison

cf gen 2000a  Generates a code file from the default template (or the template you choose)

cf parse 2000    Parse all samples from a contest
